Although the libg729 is made to be compatible with FS, you still need to change a few line or you will get memory leak.


1) replace $FS/src/mod/codec/mod_g729/mod_g729.c with this version
2) check out libg729
3) copy libg729.a to  $FS/libs/libg729/.libs/
4) copy libg729.h to  $FS/src/include/

make mod_g729
sudo make mod_g729-install
 
Restart FreeSWITCH and try to make a call with g729............
