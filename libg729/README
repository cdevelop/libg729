The original EasyG729A lib is created from C++, which means you cannot call functions directly in C.

I made a wrapper, so can easily call in C, also I changed the API, compatible with Freeswitch mod_g729

EasyG729A is made by http://imtelephone.com/. I can't include the library here due to the copyright issue. But you can get a free version for research from their site.

To build:
copy EasyG729A.h and EasyG729A.a to the code base.

# make
# make lib

Your can try to compile into FreeSWITCH, follow the instruction in fs_mod_g729.
