EasyG729A is a c++ lib, you can't call it from C directly, I made a wrapper so it is easy to call in C. The API is made to meet the FreeSWITCH mod\_g729 code. Obviously you can change the API to whatever you like.

Important: G729 codec is patent protected. You should still need to ask the permission of use from http://imtelephone.com

See README in detail.

Get code:

svn checkout http://libg729.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ libg729-read-only
